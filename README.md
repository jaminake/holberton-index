# holberton-index
index.html from holberton level2

and attempt to take notes and update what i'll be going through, during the holberton level 2 pre-interview chores for holberton school

and index.html from the ubuntu apache server i'm to install and configure and edit during the level 2 stage.

i have already changed the title form it works to hello holberton it works and small things like that. i've also ran it through the official html validator and made a few more changes like adding the valid icon and stuff like that :)
